## Course Description

---

This course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to computer programming for beginners. Students will learn the fundamentals of coding, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and arrays. The course will primarily use Python, a highly versatile language commonly used in many fields. By the end of the course, students should be able to solve basic problems using programming and have a strong foundation for further studies in computer science. 

*Prerequisite: None*

*Exclusion: CSC102*

*Distribution Requirement: Science*

- **Labs**
  
    Labs are designed to provide practical experience and reinforce the concepts taught in lectures. Each lab will focus on a specific topic, and students will be expected to complete coding tasks during the lab session. Lab attendance is crucial as it counts towards your final grade.
    
- **Assignments**
  
    Assignments are designed to test your understanding of the course material. They will consist of coding problems that you will need to solve individually. Assignments will be more complex than lab tasks and will often require you to apply concepts from multiple lectures.
    
- **Midterm and Final Exam**
  
    The midterm will cover all material taught up to that point in the course. The final exam will cover all course material. Both exams will consist of multiple-choice questions, short answer questions, and coding problems. Studying lecture notes and assignments is the best way to prepare.
    
- **Participation**
  
    Participation marks are awarded based on your engagement in the course. This includes posting and responding to questions on the discussion board, attending tutorials, and participating in class discussions. Regular engagement is crucial for doing well in this part of the assessment.
    

## Pentalties for lateness

---

Assignments submitted after the due date will be penalized at a rate of 10% per day, including weekends. No assignments will be accepted more than five days late unless a documented medical or personal emergency is provided.

## Course Policies

---

- **Academic Integrity**
  
    All students are expected to maintain the highest standards of academic integrity. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding actions such as cheating, plagiarizing, and providing false information. Any student found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will face disciplinary action, which could include a failing grade for the course and further sanctions from the university.
    
- **Attendance and Participation**
  
    Regular attendance and active participation in class are crucial for understanding the course material and doing well in the course. If you are unable to attend a class, please email the instructor in advance.
    
- **Electronics Policy**
  
    Use of electronics, such as laptops and cell phones, is allowed for note-taking and course-related purposes only. Any use of electronics that disrupts the class or distracts other students is not permitted.
    
- **Office Hours**
  
    Office hours are a time for you to ask questions, discuss the course material, or seek help on assignments. If you cannot make the scheduled office hours, please email the instructor or co-instructor to arrange an alternative time.
    
- **Communication**
  
    All course-related communication will be done through email or the discussion board on the course website. Please check your email and the course website regularly for updates.
    
- **Accommodations**
  
    If you require any accommodations for a disability or other reasons, please contact the instructor as soon as possible to make the necessary arrangements.
    
- **Changes to the Syllabus**
